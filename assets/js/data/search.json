    "content": "Reconnaissance  in the Reconnaissance phase i started by using nmap to enumerate the open ports, after a while nmap returns a very long list. we see that a lot of ports of interest are open like http and ssh      we can access the web page by visiting http://10.10.15.229:80/  SQLI AUTH Bypass  i tried enumerating folders but it didn’t lead anywhere.    browsing the site we can find a login page on http://10.10.15.229:80/login.php    i tried testing basic login credentials like admin:admin and admin:Password123 but nothing worked, so i intercepted a login post reequest using burp suite and used it to test the login page using sqlmap for sql injections which tells me that the username parameter appears to be injectable      i inetially tried to dump the database which was successful and revealed a single user but the password hash associated whit the user was uncrackable using online sites like crackstation and x.    so knowing the username parameter is injectable i tried some payloads and eventually this worked ' || 1=1;-- - and we were able to bypass the authetication process    LFI and RCE  visiting the messages section of the site we see a clickable link that sends you to a page with the message : If you know, you know :D  upon further inspection we realise the url is using file parameter to give us the message along with a filter http://10.10.15.229/secret-script.php?file=php://filter/resource=supersecretmessageforadmin, a simple test to try to read a world readable file turns out to be successful    we have a LFI !  we can use the convert.base64-encode filter to read the secret-script.php file like so :    to get a reverse shell we need to use this tool https://github.com/synacktiv/php_filter_chain_generator  we set our netcat listener and then we create and send our payload    and we have a shell !    user flag when we access the user comte’s home directory we can access his .ssh folder and we find an authorized_keys file,    we can generate an ssh key and add it to the file to get a shell as comte scince the file is writable      now connect via ssh    root flag  when we check the sudo priveleges for comte we see    we see that the user reload the configuration files for systemd as well start a script called exploit.timer which will start the service exploit.service, lets see the script    let’s try and run the script    it wont run! thats because the OnBootSec= parameter is empty which specifies to systemd when to to start the timer after reload lets add the missing value and execute the script    now checking for binaries with the suid set reveals a binary called xdd    we can check gtfobins and realize we can use it to read files so we use it to read  the flag    "
